Description:
Given a 2D integer matrix mat[][] of size n x m, where every row and column is sorted in increasing order and a number x, the task is to find whether element x is present in the matrix.

Examples:

Input: mat[][] = [[3, 30, 38],[20, 52, 54],[35, 60, 69]], x = 62
Output: false
Explanation: 62 is not present in the matrix, so output is false.
Input: mat[][] = [[18, 21, 27],[38, 55, 67]], x = 55
Output: true
Explanation: 55 is present in the matrix.
Input: mat[][] = [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, 9]], x = 3
Output: true
Explanation: 3 is present in the matrix.
Constraints:
1 <= n, m <=1000
1 <= mat[i][j] <= 109
1<= x <= 109


Python3:
class Solution:
    def matSearch(self, mat, x):
        n = len(mat)      # Number of rows
        m = len(mat[0])   # Number of columns
        
        # Start from the top-right corner
        i, j = 0, m - 1
        
        while i < n and j >= 0:
            if mat[i][j] == x:
                return True  # Found the element
            elif mat[i][j] > x:
                j -= 1  # Move left
            else:
                i += 1  # Move down
        
        return False  # Element not found
