Description:
A message containing letters A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping:

'A' -> 1
'B' -> 2
...
'Z' -> 26

You are given a string digits. You have to determine the total number of ways that message can be decoded.

Examples:

Input: digits = "123"
Output: 3
Explanation: "123" can be decoded as "ABC"(1, 2, 3), "LC"(12, 3) and "AW"(1, 23).
Input: digits = "90"
Output: 0
Explanation: "90" cannot be decoded, as it's an invalid string and we cannot decode '0'.
Input: digits = "05"
Output: 0
Explanation: "05" cannot be mapped to "E" because of the leading zero ("5" is different from "05"), the string is not a valid encoding message.
Constraints:
1 ≤ digits.size() ≤ 103

        def dfs(ix=len(digits)-1):
            nonlocal digits
            if ix<0:
                return 1
            ret=0
            if 1<=int(digits[ix])<=9:
                ret+=dfs(ix-1)
            if ix-1>=0 and 10<=int(digits[ix-1]+digits[ix])<=26:
                ret+=dfs(ix-2)
            return ret
        return dfs()
