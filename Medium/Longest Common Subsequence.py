Description:
Given two strings s1 and s2, return the length of their longest common subsequence (LCS). If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given string by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, "ABE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE".

Examples:

Input: s1 = "ABCDGH", s2 = "AEDFHR"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence of "ABCDGH" and "AEDFHR" is "ADH", which has a length of 3.
Input: s1 = "ABC", s2 = "AC"
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest common subsequence of "ABC" and "AC" is "AC", which has a length of 2.
Input: s1 = "XYZW", s2 = "XYWZ"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequences of "XYZW" and "XYWZ" are "XYZ" and "XYW", both of length 3.
Constraints:
1<= s1.size(), s2.size() <=103
Both strings s1 and s2 contain only uppercase English letters.

Python3:
class Solution:
    def lcs(self, s1, s2):
        m, n = len(s1), len(s2)
        dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
        
        # Fill DP table
        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if s1[i - 1] == s2[j - 1]:  # Characters match
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i - 1][j - 1]
                else:  # Take max of excluding one character
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
        
        return dp[m][n]
