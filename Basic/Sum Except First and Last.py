Description:
You are given an array arr of numbers. Return the sum of all the elements except the first and last elements.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [5, 24, 39, 60, 15, 28, 27, 40, 50, 90]
Output: 283
Explanation: The sum of all the elements except the first and last element is 283.
Input: arr[] = [5, 10, 1, 11]
Output: 11
Explanation: The sum of all the elements except the first and last element is 11.
Input: arr[] = [5, 10]
Output: 0
Explanation: The sum of all the elements except the first and last element is 0.
Constraints:
2<=arr.size()<=105
2<=arr[i]<=105
Python3:
class Solution:
    def sumExceptFirstLast(self,arr):
        # Parr:  list of pair
        #code here
        s = 0
        for i in range(len(arr) - 2):
            s += arr[i+1]
        return s
