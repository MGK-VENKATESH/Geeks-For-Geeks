Description:
Given a Binary Tree of size n, You have to count leaves in it. For example, there are two leaves in the following tree

        1
     /      \
   10      39
  /
5
 

Examples:

Input:
Given Tree is 
               4
             /   \
            8     10
           /     /   \
          7     5     1
         /
        3 
Output: 3
Explanation: Three leaves are 3, 5 and 1.
Input:
Given Tree is
          50
        /    \
      30      70
     /  \    /  \
    20   40 60   80
             \
             65
Output: 4
Explanation: Four leaves are 20, 40, 65 and 80.
Input:
Given Tree is 
          30
        /    \
      25      35
     /  \      \
    20   28     40
        /
       27
Output: 3
Explanation: Three leaves are 20, 27 and 40.
 Constraints:
1<= number of nodes <= 105
1<= node->data <= 105


Python3:
'''
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.right = None
        self.data = val
        self.left = None
'''
# your task is to complete this function
# function should return the count of Leaf node's
# Note: You required to print a new line after every test case
class Solution:
    # Function to count the number of leaf nodes in a binary tree.
    def countLeaves(self, root):
        if root is None:
            return 0
        if root.left is None and root.right is None:
            return 1
        return self.countLeaves(root.left) + self.countLeaves(root.right)
